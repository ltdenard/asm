# Assembly Playground

Welcome to my little corner of low-level wizardry.

This repository is just a space where I dabble in **assembly language** — exploring how things work under the hood, one instruction at a time. There’s no grand project or final product here — just pure curiosity and the occasional `segfault`.

## What You’ll Find Here

- Tiny programs written in assembly
- Experiments with **NASM**
- Notes, comments, and maybe a few random hacks
- Occasional masochism

## Why?

Because:
- I like understanding how things *really* work.
- Assembly is weirdly satisfying.

## Tools I Use

- [`nasm`](https://www.nasm.us/) – Netwide Assembler
- `ld` – GNU Linker
